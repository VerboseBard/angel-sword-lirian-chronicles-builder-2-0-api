# Beta 1.5 To Beta 1.9 Release Notes And AI Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-07

This document summarizes what changed from the stable Beta 1.5 baseline through Beta 1.9, and how those changes connect to the AI/API handoff material that started in the Beta 1.6 API build.

## Review Verdict

Beta 1.9 is a clean reviewed downtime UX build.

Checks run on 2026-07-07:

- `npm.cmd test`: passed. Rebuilt `assets/app.bundle.js` and ran the Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit regression suite.
- `npm.cmd run audit:minmax`: passed. No tier 3+ missing-foundation class-path issues were reported.
- `npm.cmd audit --audit-level=moderate`: passed with `0 vulnerabilities`.
- Focused browser smoke: crafting/gathering mode tabs, wizard entry, recipe selection, and gathering node draft cards were checked during the 1.9 pass.

Known remaining risks:

- The suite now has a functional crafting outcome regression, but gathering still needs deeper functional tests for node progress, repeat attempts, and awarded inventory.
- Some crafting/gathering rules are still inferred where the official rules do not give exact recipe or node details. The UI labels these cases as inferred, GM draft, or GM permission.
- A large amount of downtime behavior still lives in `src/js/ui.js`; a later hardening pass should extract reusable crafting/gathering profile helpers.

## Beta 1.5 Baseline

Beta 1.5 is the stable static/public baseline. It intentionally does not contain the API provider layer.

Important behavior carried forward:

- Character builder and live play sheet.
- Local rules versions `0.12.5`, `0.12.6`, and `0.13.0`, with fresh characters defaulting to the latest bundled version.
- Browser save/load.
- JSON, PDF, and spreadsheet export/import.
- Improved workbook import/export behavior from the earlier Roland/Masaru testing pass.
- Static browser/GitHub Pages deployment shape.

Beta 1.5 remains the clean static anchor for comparing later non-API work.

## Beta 1.6 API Build

Beta 1.6 was the API/handoff experiment and documentation package.

Important additions:

- Disabled-by-default API provider layer:
  - `assets/api-config.js`
  - `src/js/data-provider.js`
  - `src/js/api-data-provider.js`
  - `src/js/data-mapper.js`
  - `src/js/static-data-provider.js`
- AI/developer handoff docs:
  - `AI_START_HERE.md`
  - `API_HANDOFF_README.md`
  - `docs/api-integration-plan.md`
  - `docs/ai-integration-scrape-notes.md`
  - `docs/reusable-systems-map.md`
  - `docs/rules-logic-map.md`
  - `docs/state-and-data-contract.md`
  - `docs/test-behavior-map.md`
  - `docs/known-risks-and-questions.md`

Key rule from 1.6:

- Static bundled data must continue to work.
- API mode stays off unless intentionally enabled.
- No private API keys, passwords, or secret tokens belong in the browser app.

## Beta 1.7 Crafting And Gathering Workstream

Beta 1.7 started from the clean 1.5 static baseline and focused on downtime systems rather than API integration.

Major changes:

- Added Combat / Crafting / Gathering play modes.
- Built the first dedicated Crafting and Gathering front-facing interfaces.
- Removed combat-only sheet clutter from crafting/gathering views.
- Added recipe picker, recipe categories, quick filters, item/manual mode, and shop concept.
- Added build outline visuals for recipe types:
  - potion bottle / elixir
  - shield
  - armor, clothing, cloak
  - weapon and tool forms
- Added recipe material slots showing required quantity, owned quantity, missing quantity, and standard/custom prices.
- Added purchase buttons for missing materials when a standard or custom price is available.
- Added crafting dice, crafting points, spent/available tracking, and recipe point spend controls.
- Added required tool, helper tool, facility, and class support cards.
- Added facility levels and use tracking, with facility bonuses applied to the relevant crafting skill checks.
- Added gathering node drafts, node setup, required tool/ability display, node points, lucky points, strike dice, and node HP tracking.
- Added GM override for gathering readiness so a GM can allow a gather even when a tool or class ability is missing.
- Added collapsible notes/support/reference sections to reduce noise.
- Added item artwork in the blueprint area where matching item images are available.

Important 1.7 design decision:

- Missing materials, tools, class access, and GM-only uncertainties should warn the player clearly, but most downtime steps should not over-police legal play. The GM can override uncertain cases.

## Beta 1.8 Guided Downtime Wizards

Beta 1.8 rebuilt the 1.7 crafting/gathering dashboards into guided workflows.

Crafting wizard:

1. Recipe
2. Materials
3. Support
4. Rolls
5. Complete

Gathering wizard:

1. Node
2. Readiness
3. Strikes
4. Finish

Major changes:

- Replaced the old dashboard layout with step-by-step guided workflows.
- Added persistent wizard summary chips.
- Added Continue/Back navigation.
- Added crafting success/failure resolution.
- Craft success adds the crafted item to inventory and consumes materials.
- Craft failure consumes materials by default but labels that as GM-adjustable because the official failure consequences are unclear.
- Added undo for resolved craft outcomes.
- Fixed duplicate crafting outcome resolution so `Craft Succeeded` / `Craft Failed` cannot duplicate inventory/log entries.
- Added a functional regression test for duplicate craft outcome prevention.
- Added Playwright close timeouts so browser-close hangs do not leave the test suite stuck after screenshots.

Important 1.8 design decision:

- The guided wizard is the primary crafting/gathering interface. Do not resurrect the old dashboard as accidental dead code.

## Beta 1.9 New Player Downtime UX

Beta 1.9 starts from the hardened 1.8 baseline and focuses on clarity for new players.

Major changes:

- Renamed wizard steps into action language:
  - Choose Recipe
  - Gather Materials
  - Check Support
  - Roll Points
  - Resolve Craft
  - Choose Node
  - Check Access
  - Roll Strikes
  - Resolve Gather
- Added goal and next-action coach text for each wizard step.
- Replaced one-line "Soft gate" language with clearer guidance and warning panels.
- Disabled the crafting Continue button only on the empty recipe-selection state, because there is nothing meaningful to continue to before choosing a recipe.
- Kept missing material/tool/class/ability warnings as soft GM-facing gates after a selection exists.
- Fixed the 4-step gathering wizard navigation so it uses four columns instead of a phantom fifth column.
- Improved gathering resource draft cards with dedicated header/meta/yield/requirement layout.
- Fixed gathering resource card overlap by forcing multi-column resource-card grids to size rows by content.
- Preserved accessibility improvements by keeping hidden mode panels paired with `aria-hidden`.

## AI Handoff Connection

The 1.6 handoff docs remain the best map for API integration, rules logic, state/import/export contracts, test behavior, and known risks.

For any future AI/developer working from 1.9 or a promoted API build:

1. Read this file first for the 1.5 to 1.9 timeline.
2. Read `AI_START_HERE.md` and `API_HANDOFF_README.md` if the build includes the API handoff layer.
3. Read `docs/api-integration-plan.md` before changing API behavior.
4. Read `docs/state-and-data-contract.md` before changing save/import/export state.
5. Read `docs/test-behavior-map.md` before changing tests.
6. Preserve the 1.9 downtime UX decisions unless the owner explicitly revises them.

## Promotion To Beta 2.0 API Build

The recommended promoted package is a new copy, not an overwrite of the historical 1.6 API folder:

`Angel Sword Lirian Chronicles Beta 2.0 API build`

Beta 2.0 should combine:

- The Beta 1.9 crafting/gathering/new-player UX.
- The Beta 1.6 disabled-by-default API provider layer.
- A disabled-by-default security config placeholder for future official backend/auth work.
- Updated handoff docs that explain the 1.9 downtime system and the preserved API/security defaults.

The historical 1.6 API folder should remain intact as the original integration reference unless the owner explicitly asks to replace it.
