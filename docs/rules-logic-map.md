# Rules Logic Map

This document explains where the rules behavior lives and how another developer or AI should inspect it.

## Core Files

```text
src/js/rules.js
src/js/ui.js
src/js/state.js
src/js/constants.js
scripts/test-cross-browser.mjs
```

`src/js/rules.js` is the closest thing to the rules engine. `src/js/ui.js` also contains important choice and interaction behavior because the builder UI and rules logic grew together.

## Major Rule Areas

### Race And Ancestry

Useful concepts:

- primary race selection
- ancestry/subrace filtering
- race and ancestry auto-applied effects
- ancestry traits that grant elemental mastery
- secondary lineage choices such as Demon clan behavior

Start with:

```text
src/js/rules.js
src/js/ui.js
```

Search terms:

```text
getSelectedRaceDetail
getSelectedAncestryDetail
getAncestryOptionsByPrimaryRace
getTrackedElementalMasteries
lineage
clan
```

### Class Unlocks And Mastery

Useful concepts:

- selected classes
- class progression
- class mastery
- tier 2 and tier 3 prerequisite checks
- requirements that allow any one of several mastered classes
- elemental mastery unlocking classes
- non-mastery requirements, such as proficiency, spell, rune, or damage-dealing spell gates
- cascading unlocks where a race, breakthrough, item, spell, or class feature makes a later class legal

Start with:

```text
src/js/rules.js
scripts/test-cross-browser.mjs
```

Search terms:

```text
class requirement
mastery
unlock
requirementStatus
elemental mastery
getSelectedClassDetails
getSelectedClassProgress
getClassUnlockBudgetState
```

Important tests:

```text
Class requirement unlock regression
Early Ascension generic class mastery regression
Elemental Affinity mastery unlock regression
Key ability elemental mastery unlock regression
Chosen class elemental mastery unlock regression
Ancestry trait elemental mastery unlock regression
```

Important porting rule:

```text
Do not block rare legal build paths. If the rules allow a chain of choices to satisfy a prerequisite, the builder should calculate that chain and allow it.
```

Example pattern:

```text
racial or ancestry trait -> magic/spell access -> class prerequisite -> class feature or item access -> additional spell/item/class unlock
```

### Breakthroughs

Useful concepts:

- normal selected breakthroughs
- repeatable unique choices, such as Elemental Affinity, Language Training, and Weapon Training
- stackable breakthroughs, such as Skill Training
- breakthrough choice fields that become pending/resolved builder choices
- breakthrough effects that apply to stats, skills, proficiencies, and unlocks

Start with:

```text
src/js/ui.js
src/js/rules.js
src/js/constants.js
```

```

Important tests:

```text

```

### Skills And Expertise

Useful concepts:

- creation skill points
- race and class skill points
- exchanging one eligible skill point for +2 named expertise
- expertise names tied to a skill
- repeated expertise in the same specialty
- only showing active expertise on the play sheet
- expertise roll buttons adding the right bonus

```

Important tests:

```text

Named expertise regression
Sheet expertise regression
Sheet expertise roll regression
Fixed expertise regression
```

### Equipment, Items, And Materials

Useful concepts:

- equipment selection without accidental purchase on inspection
- plus/minus purchase controls
- item quantity counts
- multiple purchases of stackable materials and weapons
- generated material cards from larger source material entries
- remaining Clim tracking
- selected equipment feeding inventory rows
- custom equipment modifiers feeding combat values
- visible spreadsheet equipment rows importing/exporting as inventory
- item access that can affect build legality or spell/effect availability

Start with:

```text
src/js/ui.js
src/js/rules.js
src/js/io.js
```

Search terms:

```text

Equipment add-control regression
Equipment quantity regression
Equipment remove-control regression
Generated material card regression
Generated material inspect regression
Generated material add regression
Generated material quantity regression
Generated material decrement regression

```

### Abilities And Resource Spending

Useful concepts:

- ability cost parsing
- AP/RP/Mana spend buttons
- variable cost buttons such as 2 AP / 4 AP choices
- manual/reference abilities
- play reference detail panel
- AP recovery button
- inventory item use
- food/rest lockout behavior
- temporary HP behavior

Start with:

```text

src/js/constants.js
```

## Porting Advice

If another interface wants these rules:

1. Extract the behavior by concept, not by screen.
2. Keep the current tests nearby while porting.
3. Preserve stable IDs for classes, items, abilities, and breakthroughs.
4. Keep API data mapping separate from game rules.
5. Treat browser UI validation as guidance, not final official server validation.
